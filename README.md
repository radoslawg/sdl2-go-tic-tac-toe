# Tic tac toe implemented in Go with SDL2

This is mainly exercise in Devcontainers, devpod, Go and it's bindings to SDL2 library.

## Devpod
I use [DevPod](https://devpod.sh/)

Run it with:
```sh 
devpod up --ide none .
```

It should create container with *NeoVim* installed and configuration for *Go* already prepared. It uses *Homebrew* to provided needed applications.
On **Linux** you can use:
```sh
devpod ssh
```
However, on **Windows** it seems it does not work and I have to ssh into the container.
